# Git Conventions

## 🚨 CRITICAL MANDATORY RULES - NEVER SKIP THESE

### ⚠️ RULE #1: ALWAYS SYNC WITH MASTER BEFORE PUSHING

**BEFORE PUSHING ANY FEATURE BRANCH, YOU MUST:**

1. **Fetch latest from remote:**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Merge master into your feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/your-branch-name
   git merge origin/master
   # OR
   git merge origin/main
   ```

3. **Resolve any conflicts immediately:**
   - If conflicts occur, resolve them BEFORE pushing
   - Test after resolving conflicts
   - Commit the merge resolution

4. **Verify branch is up to date:**

   ```bash
   git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline
   # Should show NO commits (empty output means you're up to date)
   ```

5. **ONLY THEN push:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-branch-name
   ```

**❌ NEVER push a branch without syncing with master first**
**❌ NEVER create a PR if your branch is behind master**
**✅ ALWAYS verify `git log HEAD..origin/master` shows nothing before pushing**

### ⚠️ RULE #2: ALWAYS VERIFY NO CONFLICTS BEFORE CREATING PR

**BEFORE CREATING A PULL REQUEST, YOU MUST:**

1. **Check if branch is ahead/behind master:**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline  # Commits in master not in your branch
   git log origin/master..HEAD --oneline  # Commits in your branch not in master
   ```

2. **If your branch is behind master:**
   - You MUST merge master into your branch first (see Rule #1)
   - Resolve any conflicts
   - Push the updated branch

3. **Verify clean merge status:**

   ```bash
   git status
   # Should show "Your branch is up to date with 'origin/feature/your-branch'"
   # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
   ```

4. **Test that merge works:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

**❌ NEVER create a PR if `git log HEAD..origin/master` shows commits**
**❌ NEVER create a PR if there are uncommitted changes**
**✅ ALWAYS ensure branch is fully synced and tested before creating PR**

**These rules ensure you can click "Merge" on GitHub without conflicts.**

## Commit Message Format

## Git Workflow

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Creating a Branch (ALWAYS Follow This)

**FOR EVERY FEATURE OR TASK, YOU MUST:**

1. **Start from master/main**:

   ```bash
   # Switch to master/main
   git checkout master
   # OR
   git checkout main

   # Pull latest code
   git pull origin master
   # OR
   git pull origin main

   # Verify you're up to date
   git status
   ```

2. **Create new branch FROM master/main**:

   ```bash
   # Create and switch to new branch from master
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name master
   # OR
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name main

   # Verify you're on the new branch
   git branch --show-current
   ```

3. **NEVER branch from another feature branch** - Always branch from master/main

4. **NEVER start work on an existing feature branch** - Always create a fresh branch from master

### Why This Prevents Conflicts

- Starting from latest master ensures you have all recent changes
- Creating fresh branches prevents merge conflicts from old branches
- Syncing with master before PR ensures compatibility
- Clean branch history makes reviews easier

### Making Commits

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Or stage specific files
git add path/to/file.ts

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat(products): Add product search"

# Or use interactive commit for longer messages
git commit
```

### Syncing with Master/Main (BEFORE Creating PR)

**⚠️ MANDATORY: See RULE #1 and RULE #2 at the top of this file. You MUST follow them.**

**⚠️ ALWAYS sync with master/main before creating a PR:**

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# 2. Check if your branch is behind master
git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline
# If this shows commits, you MUST merge master first (see RULE #1)

# 3. Merge master into your branch
git checkout feature/feature-name
git merge origin/master
# OR
git merge origin/main

# 4. If conflicts occur, resolve them:
# - Review conflicted files
# - Resolve conflicts manually
# - Test after resolving
# - Commit the merge

# 5. Verify you're up to date (should show nothing):
git log HEAD..origin/master --oneline

# 6. Verify clean working tree:
git status
# Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"

# 7. Push updated branch
git push origin feature/feature-name
```

**Alternative: Rebase (if preferred)**

```bash
git checkout feature/feature-name
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin feature/feature-name --force-with-lease
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL**:

- **NEVER** create a PR if `git log HEAD..origin/master` shows commits
- **ALWAYS** verify branch is fully synced before pushing (see RULE #1 and RULE #2)
- **ALWAYS** resolve conflicts locally before creating PR

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Post-Merge Workflow (ALWAYS Follow This)

**AFTER A PR IS MERGED ON GITHUB, YOU MUST:**

1. **Switch back to master/main**:

   ```bash
   # Switch to master/main
   git checkout master
   # OR
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the merged changes from remote**:

   ```bash
   # Pull latest changes (including your merged PR)
   git pull origin master
   # OR
   git pull origin main

   # Verify you're up to date
   git status
   git log --oneline -5  # See recent commits
   ```

3. **MANDATORY: Clean up merged branches**:

   ```bash
   # Delete the local feature branch (it's already merged)
   git branch -d feature/feature-name

   # If branch was force-pushed or has diverged, use -D to force delete
   # git branch -D feature/feature-name

   # Delete remote branch (if not auto-deleted by GitHub)
   git push origin --delete feature/feature-name

   # Clean up stale remote branch references
   git remote prune origin
   ```

   **Why delete merged branches?**
   - ✅ Keeps repository clean and organized
   - ✅ All commits remain in git history (nothing is lost)
   - ✅ Can recreate branch from history if needed
   - ✅ Standard industry best practice
   - ✅ Makes it clear which branches are active vs merged

   **When to keep temporarily (rare cases):**
   - Hotfix needed immediately after merge (keep for 1-2 days max)
   - Related follow-up work planned (delete after follow-up is done)
   - Uncertain if merge was successful (verify, then delete)

   **Recovering deleted branch (if needed):**

   ```bash
   # Find the merge commit
   git log --oneline --merges

   # Or find commits by message
   git log --all --grep="feature name" --oneline

   # Recreate branch from merge commit
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name <merge-commit-hash>
   ```

4. **Verify you're ready for next feature**:

   ```bash
   # Confirm you're on master/main
   git branch --show-current

   # Confirm you're up to date
   git status
   ```

5. **Start next feature**: Now you can create a new branch from the updated master/main

**Why This Is Critical:**

- ✅ Ensures you always start new features from the latest code
- ✅ Prevents working on outdated code
- ✅ Keeps your local master/main in sync with remote
- ✅ Avoids merge conflicts in future features
- ✅ Maintains clean git history

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE**: **NEVER start a new feature without first pulling latest master/main after a merge.**

### Complete Feature Workflow Summary

**Full cycle from start to finish:**

1. **Start Feature**:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature master
   ```

2. **Work on Feature**:
   - Make commits
   - Push to remote
   - Create PR

3. **After PR Merged** (on GitHub):

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   git branch -d feature/new-feature  # Delete local branch
   git push origin --delete feature/new-feature  # Delete remote branch
   git remote prune origin  # Clean up stale references
   ```

4. **Start Next Feature**:
   ```bash
   git checkout master  # Already up to date from step 3
   git pull origin master  # Double-check
   git checkout -b feature/next-feature master
   ```

**Remember**: Always be up to date with master branch before starting any new work.

### Branch Cleanup Best Practices

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Always delete merged branches**

After a PR is merged, you MUST clean up both local and remote branches:

```bash
# 1. Switch to master and pull latest
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# 2. Delete local branch
git branch -d feature/feature-name

# 3. Delete remote branch (if not auto-deleted)
git push origin --delete feature/feature-name

# 4. Clean up stale references
git remote prune origin
```

**Why delete merged branches?**

- ✅ **Keeps repository clean**: Only active branches remain visible
- ✅ **Nothing is lost**: All commits remain in git history forever
- ✅ **Easy recovery**: Can recreate branch from history if needed
- ✅ **Best practice**: Standard industry practice for all teams
- ✅ **Clear active work**: Makes it obvious which branches are in progress
- ✅ **Prevents confusion**: Avoids working on old merged branches

**What happens when you delete a branch?**

- ✅ All commits remain in git history
- ✅ You can still see them with `git log`
- ✅ PR history remains on GitHub
- ✅ You can recreate the branch from any commit hash
- ✅ Nothing is permanently lost

**When to keep a branch temporarily (rare exceptions):**

- **Hotfix needed immediately**: Keep for 1-2 days max, then delete
- **Related follow-up work**: Keep until follow-up is done, then delete
- **Uncertain merge success**: Verify merge, then delete

**How to recover a deleted branch (if needed):**

```bash
# Find the merge commit or any commit from that branch
git log --oneline --merges
git log --all --grep="feature name" --oneline

# Recreate branch from merge commit
git checkout -b feature/feature-name <merge-commit-hash>

# Or recreate from any commit in that branch
git checkout -b feature/feature-name <commit-hash>
```

**GitHub Auto-Delete Setting (Recommended):**

Enable automatic deletion of merged branches in GitHub:

1. Go to repository **Settings**
2. Navigate to **General** → **Pull Requests**
3. Enable **"Automatically delete head branches"**

This will automatically delete remote branches after PR merge, so you only need to delete local branches.

**⚠️ CRITICAL RULE**: **Always delete merged branches. This is not optional - it's a mandatory part of the workflow.**

### Pushing Changes

```bash
# Push branch to remote
git push origin feature/feature-name

# Push and set upstream
git push -u origin feature/feature-name

# Force push (use with caution, only if needed)
git push --force-with-lease
```

## Commit Frequency

- **Small, frequent commits**: Commit logical units of work
- **One change per commit**: Each commit should do one thing
- **Commit often**: Don't wait until feature is complete
- **Meaningful commits**: Each commit should be meaningful and reviewable

## Best Practices

### DO

- ✅ Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Use Conventional Commits format
- ✅ Reference issues in commit messages
- ✅ Keep commits small and focused
- ✅ Test before committing
- ✅ Sync with main regularly
- ✅ Review your own commits before pushing

### DON'T

- ❌ Commit directly to `main` branch
- ❌ Write vague commit messages
- ❌ Commit broken code
- ❌ Commit large, unrelated changes together
- ❌ Force push to `main`
- ❌ Skip pre-commit hooks (if configured)
- ❌ Commit secrets or credentials

## Pre-commit Hooks (If Configured)

If using Husky or similar:

- Run linting on staged files
- Run formatting on staged files
- Run type checking
- Prevent commits with errors

## Merge Strategies

### Squash and Merge (Recommended)

- Combines all commits into a single commit
- Cleaner git history
- Easier to revert if needed
- Use for feature branches

### Merge Commit

- Preserves individual commit history
- Use when commit history is important
- Creates merge commit in history

### Rebase and Merge

- Linear history without merge commits
- Use when you want completely linear history
- Can be more complex for reviewers
