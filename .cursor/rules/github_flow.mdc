# GitHub Flow Best Practices

## 1. GitHub Flow Overview

### Core Principles

GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow designed around deployments that happen regularly. The core principles are:

- **Main branch is always deployable**: The `main` branch should always be in a state that can be deployed to production
- **Feature branches are short-lived**: Create branches from `main`, work on features, and merge back quickly
- **Pull requests are required**: All changes must go through a pull request before merging to `main`
- **Continuous integration and deployment**: Automate testing, linting, and deployment
- **Fast feedback loops**: Get feedback quickly through automated checks and code reviews
- **Simple, linear history**: Keep the git history clean and easy to follow

### Why GitHub Flow for This Project

- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand and follow than complex branching models
- **Speed**: Faster iteration cycles with shorter-lived branches
- **Quality**: PR reviews and CI checks ensure code quality before merging
- **Collaboration**: Clear process for team members to contribute
- **Deployment**: Main branch is always ready for deployment

### Key Differences from Git Flow

- **No develop branch**: Work directly from `main`
- **No release branches**: Features are merged directly to `main` when ready
- **Simpler hotfix process**: Hotfixes branch from and merge to `main`
- **Continuous deployment**: Deploy from `main` after every merge

### Integration with CI/CD

GitHub Flow works best when integrated with continuous integration and deployment:
- Automated tests run on every PR
- Status checks must pass before merging
- Automatic deployment from `main` branch
- Fast feedback on code quality

## 2. Branch Strategy

### Main Branch

- **Name**: `main` (or `master` in older repositories)
- **Purpose**: Always deployable, production-ready code
- **Protection**: 
  - Require pull request reviews before merging
  - Require status checks to pass
  - Require branches to be up to date
  - Do not allow force pushes
  - Do not allow deletions

### Feature Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, consistent branch names:

- **Features**: `feature/description-of-feature`
  - Example: `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/dashboard-analytics`
- **Bug fixes**: `bugfix/description-of-bug` or `fix/description-of-bug`
  - Example: `bugfix/login-error`, `fix/memory-leak`
- **Hotfixes**: `hotfix/description-of-issue`
  - Example: `hotfix/critical-security-patch`
- **Refactoring**: `refactor/description-of-refactor`
  - Example: `refactor/api-response-handling`
- **Documentation**: `docs/description-of-docs`
  - Example: `docs/api-documentation-update`

**Best practices for branch names:**
- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens to separate words
- Be descriptive but concise
- Include issue/ticket numbers if applicable: `feature/PROJ-123-user-login`

### Branch Lifecycle

1. **Create**: Branch from `main` when starting work
2. **Work**: Make commits on the feature branch
3. **Update**: Regularly sync with `main` to avoid conflicts
4. **Review**: Create a pull request for review
5. **Merge**: Merge to `main` after approval and CI passes
6. **Cleanup**: Delete the branch after merging

### Branch Protection Rules

Configure branch protection for `main`:
- Require pull request reviews (at least 1 approval)
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Restrict who can push to `main` (no direct pushes)

## 3. Pull Request Guidelines

### When to Create Pull Requests

- **Early and often**: Create PRs early, even as work-in-progress (use draft PRs)
- **Small, focused changes**: Keep PRs small and focused on a single feature or fix
- **Before requesting review**: Ensure code is ready for review (tests pass, linting clean)
- **For all changes**: No direct commits to `main` - everything goes through PRs

### PR Title Conventions

Use clear, descriptive titles that follow this format:

```
<type>: <short description>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
- ✅ `feat: Add user authentication with OAuth`
- ✅ `fix: Resolve memory leak in image processing`
- ✅ `docs: Update API documentation for v2`
- ❌ `Update code`
- ❌ `Fixes`
- ❌ `WIP`

### PR Description Template

Every PR should include:

```markdown
## Description
Brief description of what this PR does and why.

```

### Linking Issues and Tickets

- Use GitHub issue linking: `Closes #123` or `Fixes #123`
- Reference related issues: `Related to #456`
- Include ticket numbers in branch names when applicable
- Update issue status when PR is merged

### PR Size Recommendations

**Keep PRs small and focused:**
- **Ideal**: 200-400 lines of code changes
- **Acceptable**: Up to 1000 lines for complex features
- **Too large**: Over 1000 lines - consider splitting into multiple PRs

**Benefits of small PRs:**
- Faster review process
- Easier to understand changes
- Lower risk of introducing bugs
- Faster feedback loops

### Labels and Categorization

Use labels to categorize PRs:
- `enhancement`: New features
- `bug`: Bug fixes
- `documentation`: Documentation changes
- `refactoring`: Code refactoring
- `dependencies`: Dependency updates
- `breaking-change`: Breaking changes
- `work-in-progress`: Draft PRs
- `ready-for-review`: Ready for review
- `needs-review`: Needs reviewer attention

### Review Checklist

Before requesting review, ensure:
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] PR description is complete
- [ ] Related issues are linked
- [ ] Commit messages are clear

### Merge Strategies

**Squash and Merge** (Recommended):
- Combines all commits into a single commit
- Cleaner git history
- Easier to revert if needed
- Use for feature branches

**Merge Commit**:
- Preserves individual commit history
- Use when commit history is important
- Creates merge commit in history

**Rebase and Merge**:
- Linear history without merge commits
- Use when you want a completely linear history
- Can be more complex for reviewers

**Default**: Use "Squash and Merge" for most PRs unless there's a specific reason to preserve individual commits.

## 4. CI/CD and GitHub Actions

### Required Status Checks Before Merge

All PRs must pass these checks before merging:
- **Linting**: Code must pass ESLint checks
- **Tests**: All unit and integration tests must pass
- **Build**: Project must build successfully
- **Type checking**: TypeScript type checking must pass (if applicable)

### GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements

**Workflows should be defined in `.github/workflows/`:**

1. **CI Workflow** (runs on PRs and pushes to main):
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting
   - Run tests
   - Build project
   - Type checking

2. **Deployment Workflow** (runs on merge to main):
   - Build project
   - Run tests
   - Deploy to staging/production

### CI Runs on PRs and Main Branch Pushes

- **On Pull Requests**: Run full CI suite
- **On Push to Main**: Run full CI suite + deployment
- **On Push to Feature Branches**: Run CI suite (optional, recommended)

### Branch Protection Enforcement

Configure branch protection to:
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require up-to-date branches before merging
- Prevent force pushes to main
- Require pull request reviews

### Secrets Management

- **Use GitHub Secrets**: Never commit secrets to the repository
- **Scope secrets**: Limit secrets to only necessary workflows
- **Rotate regularly**: Update secrets periodically
- **Use environment-specific secrets**: Separate secrets for dev/staging/prod

**Common secrets:**
- API keys
- Database credentials
- Deployment tokens
- Third-party service credentials

### Workflow Efficiency

**Optimize CI/CD workflows:**
- **Parallelization**: Run independent jobs in parallel
- **Caching**: Cache dependencies (node_modules, build artifacts)
- **Matrix builds**: Test against multiple Node.js versions if needed
- **Conditional runs**: Skip unnecessary steps when possible
- **Fast feedback**: Run quick checks (linting) before slow checks (tests)

**Example optimization:**
```yaml
# Run linting and type checking in parallel
# Then run tests
# Cache node_modules between runs
```

### Status Check Requirements

- All required status checks must pass
- Status checks must be up to date (branch synced with main)
- No failing checks are allowed
- All checks must complete successfully

## 5. Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests Must Pass

- **Requirement**: All unit tests must pass before merging
- **Coverage**: Maintain reasonable test coverage (aim for 80%+)
- **Location**: Tests should be co-located with code or in `__tests__` directories
- **Naming**: Test files should be `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx`, or `*.spec.ts`

### Integration/E2E Tests

- **When applicable**: Add integration tests for critical user flows
- **Tools**: Use appropriate testing frameworks (Jest, Playwright, Cypress, etc.)
- **CI Integration**: Run integration tests in CI pipeline
- **Stability**: Ensure tests are stable and not flaky

### Test Coverage Expectations

- **Minimum**: 70% code coverage
- **Target**: 80%+ code coverage
- **Critical paths**: 100% coverage for critical business logic
- **New code**: New features should include tests

### Running Tests Locally Before PR

**Before creating or updating a PR:**
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test.file.ts
```

**Ensure:**
- All tests pass locally
- No skipped or disabled tests
- Test coverage meets requirements
- Tests run in reasonable time

### Test Commands and Scripts

**Standard test commands:**
- `npm test` or `npm run test`: Run test suite
- `npm test -- --watch`: Run tests in watch mode
- `npm test -- --coverage`: Run tests with coverage report
- `npm test -- --verbose`: Run tests with verbose output

**Add to package.json:**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2"
  }
}
```

### CI Test Execution

- **Automated**: Tests run automatically on every PR
- **Parallel**: Run tests in parallel when possible
- **Fast feedback**: Fail fast on first test failure
- **Reporting**: Generate and report test coverage
- **Artifacts**: Save test results and coverage reports

## 6. Linting and Code Quality

### Linting Requirements

**ESLint for Next.js:**
- Use `eslint-config-next` for Next.js projects
- Extend recommended configurations
- Add custom rules as needed
- Fix linting errors before committing

**Run linting:**
```bash
# Check for linting errors
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint -- --fix
```

### Code Formatting

**Prettier (if used):**
- Consistent code formatting across the project
- Auto-format on save (configured in IDE)
- Format before committing
- Use `.prettierrc` or `prettier.config.js` for configuration

**Run formatting:**
```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Lint Checks in CI

- **Required**: Linting must pass in CI before merging
- **Auto-fix**: Consider auto-fixing linting issues in CI
- **Fail on errors**: CI should fail if linting errors exist
- **Report**: Display linting results in PR comments

### Pre-commit Hooks (if applicable)

**Using Husky + lint-staged:**
- Run linting on staged files before commit
- Run formatting on staged files
- Prevent commits with linting errors
- Fast feedback before pushing

**Setup:**
```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Code Quality Gates

**Enforce code quality:**
- No linting errors allowed
- No TypeScript errors allowed
- No console.log statements in production code (use proper logging)
- No commented-out code
- No TODO comments without issue links
- Proper error handling
- Meaningful variable and function names

## 7. Build and Deployment

### Build Verification in CI

- **Requirement**: Project must build successfully before merging
- **Command**: `npm run build`
- **Failure**: PR cannot be merged if build fails
- **Artifacts**: Save build artifacts for deployment

### Build Commands and Scripts

**Standard build commands:**
```bash
# Production build
npm run build

# Development build (if applicable)
npm run build:dev

# Build for specific environment
npm run build:staging
npm run build:production
```

**Ensure build:**
- Completes without errors
- Generates expected output
- Optimizes assets correctly
- Handles environment variables properly

### Continuous Deployment from Main

- **Trigger**: Automatic deployment on merge to `main`
- **Process**: Build → Test → Deploy
- **Environments**: Deploy to staging first, then production
- **Rollback**: Have rollback procedure ready

### Feature Flags (if applicable)

- **Use feature flags**: For gradual feature rollouts
- **Configuration**: Manage flags in environment or config service
- **Testing**: Test with flags enabled/disabled
- **Cleanup**: Remove flags after feature is fully rolled out

### Rollback Procedures

**Have a rollback plan:**
- **Quick rollback**: Ability to revert to previous deployment
- **Database migrations**: Plan for backward-compatible migrations
- **Communication**: Notify team of rollback
- **Investigation**: Investigate issues after rollback
- **Documentation**: Document rollback process

### Environment Management

- **Environments**: Development → Staging → Production
- **Configuration**: Use environment variables for config
- **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, use secure storage
- **Validation**: Validate environment configuration on startup
- **Documentation**: Document required environment variables

## 8. Commit Message Conventions

### Commit Message Format

**Use Conventional Commits format:**

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (dependencies, build config, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

**Scope (optional):**
- Component or module name
- Area of codebase affected

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): Add OAuth2 authentication

Implement Google and GitHub OAuth2 providers.

The image processing service was not properly releasing
memory after processing large images.

Fixes #456
```

```
docs: Update README with setup instructions

Add detailed setup instructions for new developers.
Include environment variable configuration.
```

### Commit Frequency and Size

- **Small, frequent commits**: Commit logical units of work
- **One change per commit**: Each commit should do one thing
- **Commit often**: Don't wait until feature is complete
- **Meaningful commits**: Each commit should be meaningful and reviewable

### Good vs Bad Commit Examples

**✅ Good commits:**
