# Feature Review and Workflow

## Feature Development Workflow

### 1. Start Feature Development

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/feature-name
   ```

2. Set up feature structure:
   - Create folders: `_actions/`, `_components/`, `_hooks/`, `_lib/`, `_schemas/`, `_types/`
   - Follow the naming conventions and architecture patterns

### 2. Implement Feature

- Write code following project conventions
- Add tests as you develop
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Keep commits small and focused

### 3. Complete Implementation

When you think the feature is complete:

1. **Stop and Review**: Don't immediately create a PR
2. **Run Quality Checks**: Ensure all checks pass
3. **Use Review Checklist**: Go through the Feature Review Checklist systematically

### 4. Review Process

#### Step 1: Automated Checks

Run these commands and ensure they all pass:

```bash
# Linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build
npm run build

# Tests
npm test
```

#### Step 2: Manual Review Checklist

Go through the Feature Review Checklist (below) section by section:

- ✅ Code Quality & Architecture
- ✅ TypeScript & Type Safety
- ✅ Validation & Error Handling
- ✅ Server Actions & API Routes
- ✅ Components
- ✅ Data Fetching & Caching
- ✅ Database & Prisma
- ✅ Testing
- ✅ Performance
- ✅ Security
- ✅ Documentation & Code Comments
- ✅ Git & PR Preparation
- ✅ Final Review

#### Step 3: Fix Issues

If you find any issues:

1. **Document the Issue**: Note what needs to be fixed
2. **Fix the Issue**: Make the necessary changes
3. **Re-run Checks**: Run automated checks again
4. **Re-review**: Go through the checklist again

#### Step 4: Iterate

Repeat Step 3 until:
- All automated checks pass
- All checklist items are checked
- You're confident the feature is correct

### 5. Create Pull Request

Once everything is reviewed and fixed:

1. **Sync with Main**: Ensure your branch is up to date
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git merge main
   # or
   git rebase main
   ```

2. **Final Verification**: Run checks one more time

3. **Create PR**: Create pull request following PR guidelines
   - Use conventional commit format for PR title
   - Include comprehensive PR description
   - Link related issues
   - Reference the review checklist completion

## Feature Review Checklist

Use this checklist to review your feature implementation before creating a pull request.

### ✅ Code Quality & Architecture

- [ ] **Feature Structure**: All code is properly organized in feature folders (`_actions/`, `_components/`, `_hooks/`, `_lib/`, `_schemas/`, `_types/`)
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Files and code follow project naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities, kebab-case for actions/schemas)
- [ ] **Code Organization**: No code duplication, proper separation of concerns
- [ ] **Import Organization**: Imports follow the correct order (React → Third-party → Shared → Feature → Relative)
- [ ] **File Structure**: Components are not monolithic, logic is extracted appropriately

### ✅ TypeScript & Type Safety

- [ ] **Type Definitions**: All types/interfaces are defined in `_types/` folder
- [ ] **Type Annotations**: Functions have explicit return types (especially public APIs)
- [ ] **No `any` Types**: All types are properly defined, no `any` usage
- [ ] **Type Inference**: Types are derived from Zod schemas where applicable using `z.infer<>`
- [ ] **Component Props**: All component props are properly typed with interfaces

### ✅ Validation & Error Handling

- [ ] **Zod Schemas**: All validation schemas are in `_schemas/` folder
- [ ] **Server-Side Validation**: All Server Actions validate input with Zod schemas
- [ ] **Client-Side Validation**: Forms validate on client before submission
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Proper error handling in Server Actions, API routes, and components
- [ ] **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages (no technical details exposed)
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Error boundaries implemented where needed (`error.tsx` files)

### ✅ Server Actions & API Routes

- [ ] **Server Actions Preferred**: Using Server Actions instead of API routes for internal operations
- [ ] **API Routes Only for Public**: API routes only used for public endpoints consumed by external services
- [ ] **Response Format**: Consistent response format (`{ success: true/false, data?, error? }`)
- [ ] **Revalidation**: Cache revalidation implemented after mutations (`revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag`)
- [ ] **FormData Handling**: FormData properly extracted and validated

### ✅ Components

- [ ] **Server Components Default**: Using Server Components by default
- [ ] **Client Components Only When Needed**: `"use client"` only used when necessary (hooks, browser APIs, interactivity)
- [ ] **Component Separation**: Components are small, focused, and reusable
- [ ] **Loading States**: Loading states implemented (`loading.tsx` or Suspense boundaries)
- [ ] **Error States**: Error states handled with error boundaries
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Components are accessible (proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### ✅ Data Fetching & Caching

- [ ] **Server-Side Fetching**: Data fetching in Server Components when possible
- [ ] **Caching Strategy**: Appropriate caching strategy implemented (force-cache, no-store, revalidation)
- [ ] **TanStack Query**: Used appropriately for client-side data fetching when needed
- [ ] **Cache Invalidation**: Cache properly invalidated after mutations

### ✅ Database & Prisma

- [ ] **Migrations Used**: Database changes use Prisma migrations (never direct edits)
- [ ] **Migration Created**: Migration created and tested: `npx prisma migrate dev --name migration_name`
- [ ] **Prisma Client**: Using single Prisma Client instance from `lib/prisma.ts`
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: Queries are optimized (select only needed fields, proper includes)
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Prisma errors are properly handled

### ✅ Testing

- [ ] **Tests Written**: Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Reasonable test coverage (aim for 80%+)
- [ ] **Tests Pass**: All tests pass locally
- [ ] **Test Organization**: Tests are colocated with code or in appropriate test directories

### ✅ Performance

- [ ] **Bundle Size**: No unnecessary client-side JavaScript
- [ ] **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports used for heavy components when appropriate
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: Using `next/image` for images
- [ ] **No Console Logs**: No `console.log` statements in production code (use logger)

### ✅ Security

- [ ] **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated (client and server)
- [ ] **No Secrets Exposed**: No secrets or sensitive data in client code
- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Using environment variables for sensitive config
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: Server Actions have built-in CSRF protection
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting considered for sensitive operations

### ✅ Documentation & Code Comments

- [ ] **Self-Documenting Code**: Code is clear and self-documenting
- [ ] **Complex Logic Commented**: Complex business logic has comments explaining why
- [ ] **JSDoc Comments**: Public API functions have JSDoc comments
- [ ] **README Updated**: Feature documentation updated if needed

### ✅ Git & PR Preparation

- [ ] **Feature Branch**: Working on feature branch (not `main` or `master`)
- [ ] **Commit Messages**: Commit messages follow Conventional Commits format
- [ ] **Small Commits**: Commits are small and focused
- [ ] **Branch Up to Date**: Feature branch is synced with `main`

## Best Practices

1. **Review Early**: Don't wait until the end to review
2. **Fix Immediately**: Fix issues as you find them
3. **Document Decisions**: If something can't be checked, document why
4. **Ask for Help**: If unsure about something, ask before creating PR
5. **Be Thorough**: Take time to review properly - it saves time later
